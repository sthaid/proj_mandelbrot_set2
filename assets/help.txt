WHAT IS THE MANDELBROT SET
===================================

Complex number 'C' is in the Mandelbrot set if the 
following formula, when iterated starting 
from Z=0, does not diverge.

    Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C

A few examples, with the imaginary part of C equal to 0.

    These are not diverging:
    C=0.0 : Z=0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 ...
    C=0.1 : Z=0.0  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.1 ...
    C=0.2 : Z=0.0  0.2  0.2  0.3  0.3  0.3  0.3  0.3 ...

    Divergence has occurred when the magnitude is >= 2.
    These have diverged:
    C=0.3 : Z=0.0  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.5  0.6  0.6  0.7  0.7
                                       0.9  1.0  1.4  2.2
    C=0.4 : Z=0.0  0.4  0.6  0.7  0.9  1.2  1.9  4.0  
    C=0.5 : Z=0.0  0.5  0.8  1.1  1.6  3.2  
    C=0.6 : Z=0.0  0.6  1.0  1.5  2.9  
    C=0.7 : Z=0.0  0.7  1.2  2.1  

C values 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 are in the Mandelbrot Set. 
The values of C >= 0.3 are not in the set.

Display pixels are associated with the complex number C. 
The horizontal axis is the real part of C, and the 
vertical is the imaginary part.

A pixel is Black if the C is in the Mandelbrot Set. 
Otherwise the pixel color is chosen based on how many 
iterations it takes to determine that the sequence of Z 
values has diverged.

SOURCE CODE
===================================

https://github.com/sthaid/proj_mandelbrot_set2.git

This program is designed to be run on either Android or 
Linux; and utilizes the Simple DirectMedia Layer,
libsdl.org.

===================================
USAGE
===================================

Pan: drag

Zoom: ZIN, ZOUT zoom by a factor of 2; or 
  vertical drag the area above "FILES"

Center: tap

FILES: This program contains files of some interesting
  places in the Mandelbrot Set (MBS). Files marked with
  'Z' have all zoom levels computed. Files without 'Z' 
  have just the current zoom level computed. Scroll by 
  dragging the area to the right of the file images.

SAVE and SVZM: Are used to save additional files. 
  The SAVE button is available when the current zoom 
  level is fully computed. The SVZM button is available
  after all zoom levels have been computed. Computing all
  zoom levels can take some time.
  
SHOW: Enables Slide Show mode.

AUTOZ: Automatically zooms all of the way in, and out.
  This can be performed at any time. However, it is best
  to run autozoom after loading a 'Z' file, or waiting
  for caching of all zoom levels to have completed.

CLUT: Adjust the Color Lookup Table. CLUT is displayed.
  Colors on the left are associated with MBS values that 
  have quickly diverged (that are well out of the set).
  And colors on the right are associated with MBS values
  that are slow to diverge (that are almost in the set).

INFO: displays the following information:
  Ctr-A/B: Complex number at center of display.
  Zoom: The first number is log base 2 of the zoom factor,
    for example 0 indicates no zoom, and 4 indicates a 
    zoom factor of 16. The second number is the max zoom;
    this will be either 46 (a zoom factor of 70 trillion),
    or a lower value which indicating the zoom at which
    there is no longer any detail to display.
  CLUT: Wavelen start, and scale.
  Cache: 100% means all zoom levels have been computed.
